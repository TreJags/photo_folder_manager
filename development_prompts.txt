# JTK Labs Photo Dir Manager - Development Prompts

This file contains all the prompts used during the development of the JTK Labs Photo Dir Manager application, organized chronologically.

## Application UI Prompts

The application's user-facing text is centralized in the `prompts.js` file. These prompts include:
- Status messages
- Error messages
- Dialog titles
- Button labels
- Placeholder text
- Other UI text

## Development History Prompts

The following prompts were used during the development of the application:

### Prompt 1: Compile Application Prompts
```
Compile all the prompts for this application and store them in a file in the application directory
```

This prompt resulted in the creation of the `prompts.js` file, which centralizes all user-facing text in the application.

### Prompt 2: User Guide Button Functionality
```
WHen the User Guide button is clicked, open the text from the User_guide file in a pop up window so the rest of the application continues to run
```

This prompt led to modifications in the `createUserGuideWindow` function in `main.js` to create a window that stays on top of the main window without blocking it.

### Prompt 3: Fix Preload Script Error
```
correct the following console error in the app: VM4 sandbox_bundle:2 Unable to load preload script: C:\Engineering\GitRepos\photo_folder_manager\renderer\user-guide-preload.js executeSandboxedPreloadScripts @ VM4 sandbox_bundle:2
```

This prompt resulted in updating the `main.js` file to reference the `user-guide-preload.js` file in the root directory instead of the one in the renderer directory.

### Prompt 4: Fix Autofill Errors
```
COrrect the following errors: [49472:0629/190052.750:ERROR:CONSOLE:1] "Request Autofill.enable failed. {"code":-32601,"message":"'Autofill.enable' wasn't found"}", source: devtools://devtools/bundled/core/protocol_client/protocol_client.js (1)
[49472:0629/190052.750:ERROR:CONSOLE:1] "Request Autofill.setAddresses failed. {"code":-32601,"message":"'Autofill.setAddresses' wasn't found"}", source: devtools://devtools/bundled/core/protocol_client/protocol_client.js (1
```

This prompt led to updating the disable-features switch to include both 'AutofillServerCommunication' and 'Autofill' to ensure that all Autofill-related features are disabled.

### Prompt 5: Update User Guide Viewing
```
UPdate the view User Guide to work the same way in the application that the License button click views the text.
```

This prompt resulted in updating the 'open-user-guide' IPC handler to use shell.openPath instead of creating a new window, making it work the same way as the License functionality.

### Prompt 6: Compile Development Prompts
```
add all of the prompts done from the building of the application to a text file in the base directory. There are some contents of the prompts in the prompts.js directory also. Pull them all into one text file in ordre, using the History.
```

This prompt resulted in the creation of this file, which compiles all the prompts used during the development of the application.
